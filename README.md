For creating the Earthquake Visualization:
1. We get dataset from  USGS GeoJSON Feed site, which provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. 
2. Get a link from "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days"
 https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/
3. Imported and visualized the data.
4. Using Leaflet, created a map that plots all the earthquakes from  dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
5. Our data markers  reflected the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes  appeared larger, and earthquakes with 

6. Created Popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

7. Create a legend that provided context for map data.
8. Created screenshort with Image of visualization that we get.
